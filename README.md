# Solar Car 1 Driver IO Program

## Solar Car Dashboard

### Libraries/Frameworks

- [Qt](https://www.qt.io/) - Development framework
- [RapidJSON](https://rapidjson.org/) - JSON parsing library

### Cloning the Data Format Repository and Initializing the Submodule

0. If you don't already have an SSH key, [generate a new SSH key](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent) (only the steps under "Generating a new SSH key" are required) and [add it to your GitHub account](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account).
1. Once you have an SSH key, clone the [sc1-data-format repository](https://github.com/badgerloop-software/sc1-data-format) to your computer. Make sure to clone it using SSH (when you go to copy the clone link, there will be an SSH option above the link).
2. Next, `cd` into the `sc1-driver-io` repository and run `git submodule update --init`.

### Running the Dashboard

0. To run the project on a Raspberry Pi, see "Compiling and Running the Project on a Rapberry Pi" below. Otherwise, to run the project through Qt Creator, follow the steps below.
1. Ensure that you have [Qt](https://www.qt.io/download-open-source?hsCtaTracking=9f6a2170-a938-42df-a8e2-a9f0b1d6cdce%7C6cb0de4f-9bb5-4778-ab02-bfb62735f3e5) installed on your computer.
2. Clone the repository to your computer (see steps 0-1 of "Cloning the Data Format Repository and Initializing the Submodule" for instructions on cloning a repo using SSH).
3. If you have not already, clone the `sc1-data-format` repository and initialize the submodule (see instructions above).
4. Run `git submodule update --remote` to update the `sc1-data-format` submodule.
5. Open Qt Creater and configure the project using the appropriate kit for your environment.
6. When the project is open, simply press the green arrow in the bottom-left corner of the window.

### Contributing to the Dashboard

0. Again, make sure you have [Qt](https://www.qt.io/download-open-source?hsCtaTracking=9f6a2170-a938-42df-a8e2-a9f0b1d6cdce%7C6cb0de4f-9bb5-4778-ab02-bfb62735f3e5) installed on your computer.
1. Clone the repository to your computer (see steps 0-1 of "Cloning the Data Format Repository and Initializing the Submodule" for instructions on cloning a repo using SSH).
2. If you have not already, clone the `sc1-data-format` repository and initialize the submodule (see instructions above).
3. Open the repository in Qt Creator and, if necessary, configure the project using the appropriate kit for your environment.
4. Run `git submodule update --remote` to update the `sc1-data-format` submodule. You should also do this any time the submodule might have changed (i.e. whenever the [data format](https://github.com/badgerloop-software/sc1-data-format/blob/main/format.json) has been modified).
   1. To avoid pushing changes that use obsolete data, update the submodule before you `git push` your changes. If there are changes to the data format, run the dashboard to make sure your code still works.
5. To run the dashboard on your computer, simply press the green arrow in the bottom-left corner of the Qt Creator window. To run the project on a Raspberry Pi, see "Compiling and Running the Project on a Rapberry Pi" below.
6. Once you have finished making your necessary changes to your code, switch to a new branch that has a good name for the feature or names the Jira issue (e.g. `SW-23/skeleton`).
7. Commit related changes to that branch and push to this repository. (Do this often so that it is easy to finely revert to a previous state!)
    1. When committing and pushing changes, do not add your solar-car-dashboard.pro.user file to the version control, as this is specific to your computer.
8. Once you are happy with the state of your code, open a pull request and request someone to conduct a code review. It may be kicked back with some suggestions or edits, but when it is accepted, it will be merged with `main`. Congrats! Now it's just time to rinse and repeat.

### Installing dependencies

0. If running the project on the driver IO board, skip this step, as the necessary dependencies have already been installed on it. Otherwise, if you have not already, install the dependencies on the Raspberry Pi:
    ```
    sudo apt-get install build-essential
    sudo apt-get install qt5-doc qtbase5-examples qtbase5-doc-html qtdeclarative5-dev qml-module-qtquick-controls2
    ```
### Compilation options
0. To compile the project with firmware's system:
   ```
   mkdir build
   cmake -DFIRMWARE=ON ..
   ```
   To compile the project with generated data:
   ```
   mkdir build
   cmake -DFIRMWARE=OFF ..
   ```
   To run the application after compile:
   ```
   ./solar-car-dashboard
   ```
1. No additional settings needed to run with data generator on an IDE. If you want to configure your IDE for firmware build, go to cmake settings and add ```-DFIRMWARE=ON``` to the cmake options to enable firmware build.
